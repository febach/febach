- 👋 Hi, I’m @febach
- 👀 I’m interested in (research) software development, music, science and the nature of reality
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to live on planet earth and organize myself here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a starship. Or (at least) great services and software as long as starships are out of reach.
- 📫 How to reach me? felix.bach at fiz-karlsruhe.de
